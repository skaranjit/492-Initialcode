# 492-Initialcode

There are 2 libraries associated with main app. The main app will call these libraries and its modules. The create_ds.py will generate and clean the raw text file either from Internet, pdf(currently in progress) or text(currently in progress). Once the raw text file is achieved, it will be given to loadModule to load into our module (*currently in progress, as of now it goes to Ipython shell). once loaded and tokenized i will be allowing user to ask question about the text or files they used and hopefully answer it correctly using the model that has been trained on SQUAD dataset.
